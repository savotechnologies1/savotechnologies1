    We may, at our discretion, refund the value of unspent (unused) credits for which you have previously paid if:
    <br/><br/>
    - You have mistakenly purchased credits without any intention to do so. However, you are not entitled to the Voluntary Refund if your mistake has nothing to do with the Service (e.g., intended overcharge); or
    <br/> <br/> 
    - Your account is blocked/terminated (usually upon your request).
    <br/> <br/> 
    Please note that you may request the refund of unspent credits not more than 5 (five) times. This rule does not apply to the refund of unspent credits if you cancel an order for gifts or flowers.
    <br/> <br/> 
    Please note that we may refund no less than 20 US dollars equivalent of unspent credits. If a monetary value of the remaining unspent credits is less than 20 US dollars, we reserve a right to decline your request to refund this amount of credits.

    For the avoidance of doubt, bonus credits provided to you for free are non-refundable in any event.
