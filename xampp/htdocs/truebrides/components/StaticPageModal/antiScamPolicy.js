export const antiScamIntroText = `Without question, we take the safety and security of our Members very seriously. When the dating environment is toxic with fraudulent activity and dishonesty, relationships cannot thrive. Our top priority at TrueBrides.com is to make each Member feel not only special, but also secure.
<br/><br/>
As part of our mission to provide the best possible service, we utilize a comprehensive Anti-Scam Protection Policy. First, it is important for our Members to understand what we mean by a "scam" and how a "scammer" might attempt to operate within a site like TrueBrides.com. Second, we will explain how our Anti-Scam Protection Policy operates to shut down scammers before they can communicate with our Members.
<br/><br/>
A scammer is any Member who intentionally uses our site for dishonest or fraudulent purposes. A scammer has no intention of engaging in a meaningful relationship with other Members. Therefore, the only purpose for using the site is for personal and/or financial gain.
<br/><br/>
Scamming behavior includes:
<br/><br/>
- Requesting money through Chats or Emails  <br/>
- Presenting false personal information in a Member profile <br/>
- Impersonating other people during communications <br/><br/>

The major reason we have an Anti-Scam Protection Policy in place is to provide the utmost protection to our Members. We value user trust and a violation in this area is not taken lightly by TrueBrides.com. Anyone engaged in scamming or dishonest behavior will be immediately and permanently banned from TrueBrides.com. If you think you may be communicating with a scammer, please do not hesitate to let us know about your suspicions.`;

    text: `TrueBrides.com does not compensate its Members for using the site, nor does it hire models to impersonate genuine Members. Our aim is to always provide a safe virtual dating environment that fosters flourishing connections. There are four main ways we safeguard our Members:
    <br/><br/>
    1.1. Video Verification of Member Identity
    <br/> <br/> &emsp;
    Through video, Members must verify their passport and background information. In this way, TrueBrides.com establishes facts and accurate details of the Members.
    <br/> <br/> &emsp;
    Moreover, to confirm that no one other than our Members are engaging in site communication, we require the use of Live Video on a consistent basis.
    <br/><br/>
    1.2 Verification of Member Identification Documents
    <br/> <br/> &emsp;
    Along with the video verification of the Member, our local staff has access to Member documents. This is one of the most vital steps in verifying Member identity and intention to register on TrueBrides.com.
    <br/> <br/> &emsp;
    Although we confirm the identity of our Members and provide our best efforts to stop scammers, the true intent of an individual cannot always be discovered. No one, including TrueBrides.com, can guarantee the intent of any other individual. Therefore if, in the unfortunate event, you believe you have encountered a Member with improper motivations, please contact us right away. If it is confirmed that a Member is a scammer, their profile will be removed from our database immediately.
    <br/><br/>
    1.3. Prohibition of Money Requests
    <br/> <br/> &emsp;
    Members of TrueBrides.com are not allowed to ask for money. If you find yourself in a situation where a Member is requesting these things from you, please notify us immediately.
    <br/><br/>
    1.4. Removal of Member Account Upon Violation of Site Policy
    <br/> <br/> &emsp;
    A member misidentifies him/herself (i.e., someone who uses another member’s profile without permission to communicate with you). We will reimburse all credits you incurred communicating with this member and ban the member permanently.
